This project is an implementation of an elevator using Object Oriented Programming in C++

The elevator carries people from one floor to another, based on the user's input. The project includes a UML design, OOP C++ code, and a GUI created using C++ Builder.

## UML Design:

The UML design for the elevator includes the following classes:

    Elevator: This class contains the main logic for the elevator. It has private data members such as the current floor, maximum floors, and elevator direction. It also contains public member functions such as moveUp, moveDown, and stop.

    Floor: This class represents each floor in the building. It has a private data member for the floor number and a public member function for the elevator to stop at this floor.

    Button: This class represents the buttons on each floor that the user presses to call the elevator. It has private data members for the floor number and the direction of the elevator requested.

    Controller: This class manages the overall control of the elevator. It has private data members such as the current floor and the direction of the elevator. It also contains public member functions such as addFloorRequest and processFloorRequests.

## OOP C++ Code:

The OOP C++ code for the elevator includes the implementation of the above classes. It uses object-oriented concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to simulate the behavior of an elevator.

## GUI using C++ Builder:

The GUI for the elevator was created using C++ Builder. It allows the user to interact with the elevator using buttons to call the elevator, select a floor, and start the elevator. The GUI is intuitive and easy to use, making it ideal for both experienced and novice users.

The project includes a UML design, OOP C++ code, and a GUI created using C++ Builder. To run the code, simply compile the files and run the executable.

If you find any issues or bugs, please create an issue in the repository. If you would like to contribute to the project, please fork the repository and create a pull request.

Thank you for using our elevator simulation!
